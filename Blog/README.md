Blog Application

This applications is a basic app made with Wakanda. There is 2 version one for Wakanda V1 Beta and one for Wakanda V2 Dev.

You can open the solution and then the project.

There is 2 account : admin p:admin and jean p:jean. 

Then you can run the project and test how you can create news and put comments.

Is there a basics uses of Wakanda :

	- A RPC Function for register and for get the blog informations.

	- The model is in free form mode. So you have to write yourself the methods and events.

	- There is a blog.html page who representation of news are linear. Look at the code.

Thanks for downloading my blog app. It's a basic app but it implement some Wakanda rules that can be interesting for new user of Wakanda.
